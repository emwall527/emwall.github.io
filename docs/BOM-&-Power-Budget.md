# Bill of Materials & Power Budget

## Bill of Materials (__Last Edited__: 2/25/2025)

### Description
The bill of materials lists all components across documents, including their quantity, model number, and manufacturer. It will be updated as final part selections are made. For certain components, such as resistors, bulk ordering will be used to simplify procurement and reduce the need for individual orders. To ensure seamless integration, all resistors will be kept at a consistent size regardless of the final selection.

## Power Budget (__Last Edited__: 2/25/2025)

### Description
To ensure sufficient power delivery for all required hardware, I have generated this power budget to illustrate the power allocation necessary to operate key components. The primary power draw comes from the Vybronics DC motor when in motion, while the PIC18F27/47Q10 and SunLED contribute minor consumption.
