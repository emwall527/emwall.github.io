## Decision Making
Our team’s design and decision-making process began with exploring various project options, with a primary focus on ease of manufacturing and maximizing educational value. It was crucial for us to create a fun, engaging platform for students while ensuring the project remained achievable. We wanted to avoid overcomplicating the design to the point where meaningful progress would be difficult. Initially, we brainstormed as many ideas as possible and categorized them by the team members who suggested them. This approach ensured equal representation from everyone and allowed us to generate ideas without external influence. After compiling all ideas, we categorized them using useful identifiers to refine our selection. Ultimately, we selected the final idea through a voting process. Each team member chose ideas proposed by others and critiqued their own suggestions. After voting, we focused on aligning the selected ideas with our educational goals. This led us to choose a simulated wind tunnel as the final project, which we believed would effectively meet our educational objectives and remain feasible within the project’s scope.

## Version 2.0 Improvements
If I were to create a "Version 2.0" of my hardware design, one of the first improvements I would focus on is reworking the 3.3V regulator. In the current version, the regulator didn't function as expected, which ultimately caused my entire system to fail. This issue was a major setback, as it prevented the system from operating at all, and I was unable to test or verify any other components of the design. The failure of the 3.3V regulator highlighted the critical importance of reliable power regulation, which is essential for the proper functioning of all components in the system. In a future iteration, I would make sure to thoroughly test and validate the regulator circuit before proceeding with the rest of the design.

Additionally, I would focus on improving the overall design of the printed circuit board (PCB). This would involve ensuring proper trace widths, clear component placement, and careful routing to minimize noise and signal interference. Creating a more robust and reliable PCB layout would help avoid the issues I encountered with power distribution and ensure that all components are functioning as intended.

Another key improvement would be incorporating more peer review and collaboration during the design and testing phases. In this version, I would involve more team members and experts to check my work at various stages of the project. By seeking feedback earlier in the process, I could identify potential flaws or design issues before they become significant problems. This collaborative approach would not only improve the quality of the final product but also reduce the likelihood of encountering unexpected failures during testing.

Finally, I would invest more time in prototyping and iteration. Instead of finalizing the design too quickly, I would take the time to test each individual component before integrating it into the full system. By ensuring that each part of the system works as expected in isolation, I could avoid the cascading failures that occurred due to the initial power supply issue. This more methodical approach would ultimately lead to a more reliable and functional system for the next version of the project.
